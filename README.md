This is first file I am writing into Github 

To add git into github I entered commands:

git push --set-upstream origin master
krishnatejab17

and the password we should generate from Github token (classic)


After that I created new branch under master

git checkout -b master

It will automatically copied all data from git master branch

Now we can do changes in feature branch and merge them into master branch


Now I created new branch called feature2 using the command:

git checckout -b feature2

and it will automatically copy all files in master branch.
