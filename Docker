# Docker:
Docker engine is only SPOF (single point of failure)

To avoid this "Buildah" to create images 


Dockerhub runs on root user so we need to create ubuntu user:
 sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu


#create new docker image:


Login into AWS EC2
create one directory (ex: docker_first)
create file (hello_world.py) and use basic python code in it.
create file name "Dockerfile"  exactly.
In Dockerfile write docker code.
Then create Docker image using (docker build -t hello-python-image .) command.  -t means tag name of image
Run the container using (docker run imagename)
Then you will get the outpiut

#To push the image into your dockerhub:
login into docker using (docker login -u username) (then password in  next line)
enter docker images command
You will get docker image id
Then run docker tag <image-id> krishnatejab17/imagenameyouwant

docker push krishnatejab17/imagenameyouwant

#Docker Multistage build and Distoless images

Using docker mutistage build we can reduce the size of docker image
Entry point : we can not change the value (not a variable value)

#using distoless images we can reduce size of image by 100 times
Not only reducing size but also it can imorove security to docker file.
We can not even run basic commands like ls,cd...
